On March 5th, Jasmine Hughes wrote in a New York Times blog recently at an IRL party,

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:17,580
that is a party that takes place in real life as opposed to where I generally live,

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:27,960
which is on the internet, a guest asked a friend and I how we met. The sentence includes

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,740
a common error I have been seeing and hearing more and more often lately. The error is using the

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:47,960
subject pronoun I when the object pronoun me should be used. Even President Obama can be heard using

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:58,080
I for the object of a sentence. At his first press conference on November 7th, 2008,

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:08,120
he spoke about being invited to tour the White House. Well, President Bush graciously invited

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:19,620
Michelle and I to meet with him and First Lady Laura Bush. English has eight subject pronouns,

9
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:34,280
I, you, he, she, it, we, you, and they. Subject pronouns show the actor in the sentence.

10
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:47,800
For example, in the sentence, I speak English, I is the actor. English also has eight object

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:02:02,900
pronouns, me, you, him, her, it, us, you, and them. We use an object pronoun to show

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:13,860
the receiver of the action in a sentence. As in, she gave the book to me. In that sentence,

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:26,460
me is the receiver. People often confuse subject pronouns and object pronouns in sentences with

14
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:35,640
two receivers. Take the sentence, President Obama gave an award to my brother

15
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:45,020
and me. We can easily see the need for an object pronoun because of a preposition

16
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:58,320
too. But some sentences do not have prepositions. As in, Obama asked my brother and me some

17
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:09,040
questions. The sentence still needs the object pronoun me. However, some people might want to say

18
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:18,980
Obama asked my brother and I some questions. You know that sentence has a grammar error

19
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:28,800
because I is not an object pronoun. I think the confusion about I and me

20
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,880
comes from instruction we get as children to be polite. When we mention ourselves and another

21
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:45,960
person in a sentence, we are told to put the other person first. For example, we might be reminded to

22
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:56,000
say my brother and I went to the White House. Saying I and my brother went to the White House

23
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,800
is grammatically correct but would sound impolite or rude. So English speakers who are faced with

24
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:20,380
two people in the object position in a sentence often grab for the phrase somebody and I. They do

25
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,980
not notice the phrase is grammatically incorrect. It just sounds more polite.

26
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:40,540
Another theory about the I or me error comes from a 2009 New York Times article The Eyes Have It.

27
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:49,000
Writers Patricia T. O'Connor and Stuart Kellerman guess that people correct children

28
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,120
who use me instead of I so much. The children grow up to use I even when it is wrong.

29
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,720
They explain the term for this linguistic phenomenon is hyper correction.

30
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:17,180
Back to Ms. Hughes her party and the New York Times blog. Her sentence should be rewritten as

31
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:26,440
a guest asked a friend and me how we met. Shortly after I called the error to the newspaper's

32
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:35,080
attention it was corrected. A simple way to check for the correct pronoun in a case like this

33
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:45,980
is mentally to eliminate the second person. Try saying in your head a guest asked me how we met

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:57,080
or a guest asked a friend how we met. That simple check makes choosing the correct pronoun easier.

35
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:06,080
Now you will always know the right pronoun to use. Take it from me. I'm Jill Robbins.

36
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:18,140
And now words in this story. Error. Noun. Something that is not correct. A wrong action

37
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:30,360
or statement. Mistake. Instruction. Noun. The action or process of teaching. The act of instructing

38
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:42,740
someone. Phenomenon. Noun. Something such as an interesting fact or event that can be observed

39
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:56,440
and studied and that typically is unusual or difficult to understand or explain fully.

40
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Hyper correction. Noun. The mistaken use of a word form or pronunciation based on a false analogy

41
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:17,480
with a correct or prestigious form. Now it's your turn. In the comment section

42
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,220
tell us about your own grammar gripes. What do people say in your language that bothers you?

43
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
What do people say in your language that bothers you?
