00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel Sparkle English where I help you improve your grammar,

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,720
punctuation, and writing skills. In today's lesson, we're going to talk about when to use

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,620
apostrophe S to make a noun possessive

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,160
versus the preposition of.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,960
This can be very confusing for English learners and even for native speakers. At the end of this lesson,

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,840
we will have a short quiz.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:37,680
In English grammar, we usually use apostrophe S to indicate possession when we are talking about people and

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:47,620
animals. If something belongs to Jim, I can say that is Jim's car or Jim's dog.

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,200
For example, the boy's bike.

10
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,960
The bike belongs to the boy, so I can use apostrophe S

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,260
to make that clear. In English, we don't say the bike of the boy.

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,680
When we want to talk about something that belongs to a person or an animal, we use

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,920
apostrophe S.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,040
Here's another example.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,020
The cat's toy.

16
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,420
The toy that belongs to the cat.

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,040
We wouldn't say the toy of the cat.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,700
Now, usually, we write apostrophe S.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,320
Sometimes, the apostrophe comes after the S if the noun is plural.

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,400
I have linked you in the description below to a video that discusses this in detail because it's a big topic.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,880
We can also use apostrophe S with time expressions to indicate a duration or a period

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,460
associated with an action or event.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,360
For example, with singular time expressions, we add apostrophe S

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,600
after the noun. For example, a day's work.

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,200
One year's notice. A month's rent.

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,620
This week's top hits. For example, on the radio. This week's best music.

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:26,060
There's a popular song by the Beatles called A Hard Day's Night with apostrophe S after day.

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,200
Now, could you rephrase these and use of?

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,520
For example,

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,500
instead of a month's rent,

31
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,520
could you say the rent of a month or a

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,680
notice of one year? If you rephrase these with of, they are grammatically correct.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,920
Although, they may sound more formal and less natural than these forms with apostrophe S.

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,920
Now, with plural time expressions, when the noun ends in S, we add the apostrophe after.

35
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,500
So, two weeks vacation.

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Five months salary.

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:15,200
Three hours drive. For example, my uncle's house is a three hours drive from my parents house.

38
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:24,860
Again, in the description below, I've linked you to my lesson on when we use apostrophe S versus S apostrophe.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,360
So, we've discussed that we use apostrophe S with people, with animals, and with time expressions.

40
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,680
But what about things?

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,840
So, when it comes to inanimate objects or things, the rules of possession change.

42
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,820
For example, what do you call this?

43
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,700
In English, we would call this the car door.

44
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,040
It's not natural to say the car's door because a car is not a person or an animal.

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,020
So, we would not use apostrophe S and the door of the car sounds quite formal and not natural.

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,260
In English, we say the car door and this is a compound noun.

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,280
So, again, avoid using apostrophe S with things and objects.

48
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,840
And as we saw with the previous example, car door, which is a compound noun,

49
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,880
compound nouns are a common way to express possession with objects.

50
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,060
The two nouns are combined into one, where the first noun acts like an adjective

51
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,320
describing the second noun.

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,180
Let's look at some more examples of compound nouns.

53
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,660
Now, all of these examples are open form compound nouns,

54
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,980
which means we don't push the words together or add a hyphen.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,620
Stay tuned as I will do a video on compound nouns because it's also a big topic.

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,260
For example, book cover, window pane, door handle, bicycle wheel,

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,560
room key, car engine, kitchen table.

58
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,100
Rather than say the table of the kitchen, we would say the kitchen table.

59
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:28,020
You can see in all of these examples, the first noun essentially describes the second noun.

60
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,020
What type of table is it?

61
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,420
It's a kitchen table or a dining room table.

62
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,680
What type of wheel is it?

63
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,880
It's a bicycle wheel or a car wheel.

64
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,760
Now, could you use the preposition of?

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Can I say the cover of the book or the wheel of the bicycle?

66
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,940
So, let's talk about the difference between using a compound noun and the preposition of.

67
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,940
First, we're going to compare these sentences.

68
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,700
We finally decided on the color of the wall for our living room,

69
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,580
a soothing shade of blue that complements the curtains.

70
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,900
Okay, in the first example, we have used the preposition of.

71
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,700
We finally decided on the color of the wall.

72
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,140
Let's compare that with the use of a compound noun.

73
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,300
When choosing wall color, it's important to consider the room's natural lighting and size.

74
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,640
Both of these sentences are accurate and correct.

75
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,420
But what's the difference?

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,080
What's the difference between saying color of the wall and wall color?

77
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:52,020
In the first example, cover of the wall is used to specifically refer to the color chosen

78
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,640
for a particular wall in the living room.

79
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,540
And it emphasizes the importance of this specific wall and this specific color.

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,860
In the second example, it's more general.

81
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,180
Wall color is used in a more general way to refer to the concept

82
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,060
of selecting a paint color for walls in any room.

83
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,640
So, in some instances, using of allows us to be more specific

84
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,600
and the compound noun is a bit more general.

85
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,960
Let's look at some other examples that are similar to this one.

86
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,620
The sound of the piano in the concert hall was mesmerizing.

87
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,880
Piano sound can be soothing and is often used in relaxation music.

88
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,700
So, in this example, again, when we use the preposition of the sound of the piano,

89
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,380
it's more specific.

90
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,780
We're focusing on the sound produced by a particular piano,

91
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,380
this piano in the concert hall.

92
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,640
And in the second example, with the compound noun, piano sound,

93
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,880
it's more general.

94
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,400
We're talking about piano sound in general produced by pianos in music.

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,140
We're not talking about a specific piano or a specific piano sound.

96
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,280
Here's another example.

97
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,900
The design of the dress she wore to the gala was unique and elegant.

98
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,980
Dress design is a competitive field in the fashion industry.

99
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,400
Once again, using the preposition of allows us to be more specific.

100
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,700
We're focusing on the design of a specific dress.

101
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,960
And with the compound noun, dress design,

102
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,660
we're referring to the field or to the concept of designing dresses.

103
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,080
Now, there are other instances when we use of for possession.

104
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,560
In English, the preposition of is often used to express a relationship

105
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,960
where something is a component or part of a larger entity.

106
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,280
And this is very common when referring to parts of inanimate objects,

107
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,520
groups, or abstract concepts.

108
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
For example, a member of the team.

109
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,400
This shows that an individual belongs to a team, one of the books.

110
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,360
This can specify that a particular book belongs to a collection of books.

111
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,280
The end of the video.

112
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,480
This indicates that the end part belongs to the video,

113
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,640
the president of the country, the top of the hill.

114
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,780
This is referring to the uppermost part that belongs to the hill.

115
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,860
The concept of freedom, a type of emotion.

116
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,620
So these phrases express a relationship between a part of a whole

117
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,960
to a category, a group, or concept.

118
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,460
Now, you might have noticed in the first example,

119
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,000
a member of the team, you could also say a team member.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,400
So remember, in English, there are many different ways to say the same thing.

121
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,140
So try not to stress too much about if you should use a compound noun or of.

122
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Just remember that apostrophe S is used for people, animals, and time expressions.

123
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Now, I'd also like to talk to you about this pattern.

124
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,620
And this is very common in spoken English.

125
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,520
Sometimes we use noun phrase plus of plus a possessive pronoun.

126
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,540
Now, a possessive pronoun is mine, yours, hers, ours.

127
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,340
Not to be confused with a possessive adjective.

128
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,880
And this structure is useful for emphasizing a relationship

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,380
or belonging in a more informal, casual, and conversational way.

130
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,600
For example, a colleague of mine will join us for lunch.

131
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,040
This is correct.

132
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,280
You could also say, my colleague will join us for lunch.

133
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,340
But sometimes when we're speaking in English, we will speak with this pattern.

134
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,300
And it's very important that if you use this pattern,

135
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,460
that you use a possessive pronoun after of,

136
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,160
you can't say a colleague of me or a colleague of my.

137
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,960
That would be incorrect.

138
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,800
A colleague of mine.

139
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,840
I'm waiting for a friend of theirs.

140
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,320
Or I'm waiting for their friend.

141
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,080
Is Jeremy a relative of yours?

142
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,620
Or is Jeremy your relative?

143
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
So this is another way that we use possessives in English.

144
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,680
And this is something that is more common in spoken English.

145
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,060
It is perfectly fine to say my colleague instead of a colleague of mine.

146
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,040
Both ways are correct.

147
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,580
Now we're going to do a quiz.

148
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,300
There are eight sentences in total,

149
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,740
and you must identify and correct any errors.

150
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,760
Let's begin.

151
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,580
Number one, the door of the car needs to be repainted.

152
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,620
Number two, the cat of Amy is really friendly.

153
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,300
Number three, a friend of me is coming to dinner.

154
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,420
Number four, I didn't like the movie end.

155
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,400
It was terrible.

156
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,140
Number five, two weeks notice is required to leave your job.

157
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,160
Number six, you just need a good night's rest.

158
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,840
Number seven, the tail of my dog is really short.

159
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,180
Finally, number eight, she is a very valuable member of our team.

160
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,900
Okay, let's correct these together.

161
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,900
So number one is grammatically correct, the door of the car.

162
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,520
However, in everyday English, compound nouns are usually preferred,

163
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,040
and it would be much more natural to say the car door.

164
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,440
Now number two would be incorrect.

165
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,820
Even though it's grammatically correct, it's very unnatural.

166
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,780
In English, we would use the possessive S. Amy's cat is really friendly.

167
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,180
Now number three is incorrect.

168
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,880
We don't say a friend of me, we have to use the possessive pronoun mine.

169
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,080
A friend of mine is coming to dinner.

170
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,740
Or maybe you switched this and you wrote my friend is coming to dinner,

171
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,760
which would also be correct.

172
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,460
Now number four, I didn't like the movie end.

173
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,240
This is very awkward.

174
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,460
It sounds more natural to say I didn't like the end of the movie.

175
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,200
Movie end is not a common compound noun in English.

176
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,400
It's more typical to say the end of the movie.

177
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
Number five is correct, two weeks notice.

178
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,040
We have the apostrophe after the S because weeks is plural.

179
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,300
Number six is also correct.

180
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:36,620
This time we have the apostrophe before S because night is a singular noun, a good night.

181
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,500
Now number seven, while grammatically is correct, it's not natural.

182
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,900
Remember that we use apostrophe S for people and also for animals.

183
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,800
So my dog's tail is really short.

184
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,420
That would be more natural and more common.

185
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,640
And finally, number eight, this is correct.

186
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,520
She is a very valuable member of our team.

187
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,300
In this case, we're using of to show membership in a group.

188
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,240
She is one of the members that belong to the team.

189
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,960
Okay, so let me know in the comment section how many you got correct out of eight.

190
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,420
And if you have any difficulties, you can also ask me as well.

191
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,920
