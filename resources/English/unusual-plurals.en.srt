00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
For VOA learning English, this is everyday grammar.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:13,400
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, goes the Dr. Seuss children's story.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,800
Why isn't it two fishes? You may think,

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,880
Okay, it's hard to count fish, so we group them all together. No problem.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,920
It's easy to understand that farmers would not worry about making plurals when they talk about sheep.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,380
After all, they are almost always in a group.

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,660
When you have one sheep, you can also call it a ram or a ewe,

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,680
and make those nouns plural by adding an s, rams and u's.

9
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,960
Let's look at some other things we can make plural.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,560
You've got a left foot and a right foot. Put them together and what have you got?

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,800
Two feet. That doesn't follow the add an s rule either.

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,520
Same with mouse and it's plural, mice.

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,760
What happened to our neat rule for making words plural?

14
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,960
The answer is in our history. English came from German roots.

15
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,180
German grammar changes the vowel sound in the middle of the word to show it is plural.

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,740
The plural form of the German word for goose, gans, is gens.

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,180
The vowel with two dots over it is called an umlaut,

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,900
so goose becomes geese in English.

19
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,600
There are other plurals where the vowel changes, like in the German pattern.

20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:04,720
Man, men, and woman, women are examples of different vowel sounds in plural words.

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,540
Sometimes a consonant changes, as with words that end in an f sound, such as leaf.

22
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:24,340
The voiceless sound f takes on a voiced quality, or v, and an s sound is added to the word.

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,780
We have autumn leaves and sharp knives.

24
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:36,460
Another way to make plurals in English is to add the suffix en, or n.

25
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:46,320
We see this in the words brother, brethren, child, children, and ox, oxen.

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,820
These are words that come from Old English.

27
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,300
With words that come from foreign languages, there are some patterns that may help you remember the plural.

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,080
Many technical words in English came from Latin.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,300
Let's look at the plural of some words from Latin.

30
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:16,920
Words that end in U.S. drop that ending and add i to become plural, as in fungus, fungi, and cactus, cacti.

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,940
Listen to this conversation.

32
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,120
What is that orange thing in the tree?

33
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,960
It's a fungus. There are a lot of different fungi in the forest.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:41,440
For words that end in U.M., the ending changes to a, as in the words datum, data, and medium, media.

35
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,480
These two words are more common in their plural forms than the singular forms in our digital life.

36
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,740
Listen to how the words medium and media appear in this conversation.

37
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,100
I heard you got a job at the New York Times.

38
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,740
Yeah, I'm glad to be working in mass media.

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,940
But newspapers are a dying medium, aren't they?

40
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,760
Hey, I hope not. I'm writing a blog for them.

41
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:18,860
When a word from Latin ends in EX, or I-X, the plural ending is I-C-E-S.

42
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:26,100
This results in index, indices, and matrix, matrices.

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,020
Here's another conversation.

44
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,280
The financial news is bad. The Dow Jones index is down.

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,400
Don't worry. There are other indices, like employment, going up.

46
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,980
Are you ready to try making plurals with some English words?

47
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,260
Use the Germanic pattern for these words.

48
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,900
Is your answer teeth?

49
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Is your answer wolves?

50
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,800
Use the Latin pattern for these words.

51
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,040
Memorandum.

52
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,080
Your answer should be memoranda.

53
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,160
Your answer should be foci.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,960
There are many more irregular plural forms in English.

55
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,140
We'll look at those in another episode of Everyday Grammar.

56
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,580
For now, we leave you with Frank Sinatra singing Autumn Leaves.

57
00:05:35,580 --> 00:06:01,720
But I miss you most of all, my darling, when all starts.

58
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,380
Now it's your turn. Write a sentence with an unusual plural,

59
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,580
and we'll give you feedback in the comments section.

60
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,680
Thank you.
