# 1.8 Coordinate Systems
>[!info]
>OpenGL expects all the vertices, that we want to become visible, to be in normalized device coordinates after each vertex shader run. ...
>What we usually do, is specify the coordinates in a range (or space) we determine ourselves and in the vertex shader transform these coordinates to normalized device coordinates (NDC). These NDC are then given to the rasterizer to transform them to 2D coordinates/pixels on your screen.
