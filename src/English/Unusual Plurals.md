## Life on the farm
sheep
>After all, they are <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">almost always in a group</mark>. When you have one sheep, you can also call it a ram or a ewe, and make those nouns plural by adding an -s: rams and ewes.

对于sheep 这种比较大的，相对好数的，因为它们总是成群出现，所以复数形式也是sheep。如果要表示单个个体用另外的区分了单复数形式的词表示。
ram：公羊
ewe：母羊
lamb：小绵羊

两种不规则的复数变化形式：
1. foot：feet；tooth：teeth
2. mouse：mice

## The German influence
> English came from German roots. German grammar changes the vowel sound in the middle of the word to show it is plural.

goose->geese
man->men

> Sometimes a consonant changes, as with words that end in an *f* sound, such as leaf. The voiceless sound *f* takes on a voiced quality, or v and an s sound is added to the word.

autumn leaves and sharp knives.

> Another way to make plurals in English is to add the suffix -en

brother -> brethren
child -> children
ox->oxen

## Words of foreign origin
from Latin
> Words that end in -us drop that ending and add -i to become plural

fungus -> fungi 真菌 （如蘑菇）
cactus -> cacti 仙人掌

> For words that end in -um, the ending changes to -a

datum -> data
medium -> media
