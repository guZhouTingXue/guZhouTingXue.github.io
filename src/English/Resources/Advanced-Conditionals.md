## Mindmap
```markmap
# Past unreal conditional
## 作用<br> to express wishes about the past <br> They often show regret, or sad feelings about something that happened in the past.
## example <br> If I had studied, I would have passed the test.
## 结构<br> if clause: past perfect, had + past participle; <br> result clause: would have + past participle

## Conversation
### if clause: simple past
### example<br> If I knew you were coming, I'd have baked a cake
### correct form <br> If I had known you were coming, I would have baked a cake.
### know <br> simple past: knew <br> past participle: known <br> present participle: knowing

# Mixed conditional
## something that did not happen in the past has an effect in the present.
## example <br> 1. If I had been born in China, I would speak Chinese. <br> 2. If I had quit university, I would not have this job.
## emphasize a feeling of regret <br> If I had only known it was the last walk in the rain, I'd keep you out for hours in the storm.
