# Passive voice
## 什么是Passive voice
- a verb form in which the subject receivs the action of the verb
- example: I was born on a Saturday
## Active voice
- follow the subject-verb-object pattern
- example: I love you 
  
## 在subject was acted upon时不再是active voice
- imagine that someone stole your wallet
  
## 如何构建passive voice
- use a form of the verb "be" followed by a past participle verb form
  
## 构成passive voice的前提
- only transitive verbs can be passive
- you cannot say "I was arrived by train"
  
## passive voice 相比 active voice 的特点
- make the speaker or writer seem indirect and week
- which would you rather hear: "I love you" or "You was loved by me"
  
## 使用passive的情况一 the most common reason
- when the actor is unknown or unimportant
- example0: My visa was processed
- example1: My shoes were made in India
- example2: The car was imported from Germany
