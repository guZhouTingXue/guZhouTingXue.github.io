Welcome to Everyday Grammar from VOA Learning English.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,780
The English language has an interesting way of classifying words.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,860
We organize words by their function or purpose.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,360
These functions are parts of speech.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,280
You might find that a noun acts like a verb, as with the word impact.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,560
Once you would talk about something having an impact, this is the noun form of impact.

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,980
Now you can say you want to impact a decision process.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,380
That is the verb form of impact.

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,220
You know that an adjective modifies, describing a quality of a noun.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,500
For example, you drink a cup of hot tea.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,100
The adjective is hot and the noun is tea.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,280
What about lemon tea?

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,360
Lemon is a noun, isn't it?

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,980
Why is it modifying tea?

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,020
English often uses nouns as adjectives to modify other nouns.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,740
For example, a car that people drive in races is a race car.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,440
A car with extra power or speed is a sports car.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,580
Nouns that modify other nouns are called adjectival nouns or noun modifiers.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,740
For our purposes, they are called attributive nouns, so we will use that term.

20
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,600
Did you notice something unusual about the expressions with the noun car?

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,060
A car used to race other cars is a race car.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,500
Both nouns are singular.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,540
A car that has power and speed is a sports car.

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,140
Why is the first noun sports plural?

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,020
A search of the internet shows us that people started using this phrase back in 1914.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,660
Cars were a new thing then.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,920
There is no rule about whether the attributive noun is singular or plural.

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,260
Most of the time, it is singular.

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,540
But if the combination of nouns includes a plural noun, it usually stays that way.

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,740
The result is phrases like ladies' room, not lady room, for a room meant for women and girls,

31
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:45,100
and bean soup, but not beans soup, for a soup made of beans.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,200
Some grammar experts think that English speakers are using more plural nouns in this way.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,980
We have arms race, benefits office, and women leaders.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,540
At times, a singular noun changes the meaning.

35
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:16,320
An arts degree recognizes completion of a study program at a college or university in the humanities or liberal arts.

36
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,160
But an art degree is a degree in the fine arts.

37
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:31,840
When writing these attributive nouns in English, learners sometimes wonder about whether to use an apostrophe to show possession.

38
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,420
Is it a lady's with an apostrophe after the S room?

39
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,180
No, it is a lady's room with no apostrophe.

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,660
Attributive nouns do not need the apostrophe.

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:58,140
So we write veteran's day, no apostrophe, in American English, and not veteran's with apostrophe S

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,140
after the word veteran, or veteran's with an apostrophe after the S, day.

43
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,800
That means the day is in honor of military veterans, not owned by veterans.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,060
Try to identify the attributive nouns George Harrison uses in the Beatles song, Pickies.

45
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,030

46
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,750
Now it's your turn.

47
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,010
Write a sentence that uses an attributive noun in the comments section.
