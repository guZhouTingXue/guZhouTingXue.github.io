1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:10,240
Wow, I sure do love cats. I suppose I didn't know how much until my social media service

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:19,560
informed me I had liked eight pictures of cats this week. Maybe I should get a cat or stay

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,520
off of social media. If you listened closely, you may have noticed that I did not use an

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:38,100
article in my first two sentences about cats, but I did in my third. There, I used the article

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,920
A. On our program today, I will tell you why and share some simple rules for when not to

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:57,500
use articles. As you may know, English articles refer to the words A and and the. Even some

7
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:05,900
English learners with years of training have trouble with these little words and for good reason. The

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:14,140
rules differ from language to language, making it tricky to know when to use them. But don't worry,

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:23,560
the good news is that some kinds of nouns do not require articles in speech or writing. This idea

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:33,640
is often called the zero article. The term zero article itself is not very important. It is just

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:42,920
a way of saying no article is used. There are many kinds of nouns that are not preceded by

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:52,220
articles in English. Other nouns get no article only in some kinds of statements, such as

13
00:01:52,220 --> 00:02:02,200
generalizations. To begin, we do not use articles before plural nouns and non-count nouns when making

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:11,580
generalizations. A generalization is a broad statement or an idea that can be applied to a

15
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:21,480
whole group of people or things. As you may know, a plural noun is the form of a word that relates

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:31,940
to more than one person or thing, like apples, dogs, telephones, and children. Let's listen to

17
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:40,100
an example of a generalization with plural nouns. Dogs are much more playful than cats.

18
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,920
This is a very broad statement applied to two groups of animals, so we do not use articles.

19
00:02:51,480 --> 00:03:00,640
We do, however, use articles with plural nouns in specific statements. Here is an example for comparison.

20
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:10,160
The dogs at the doggy park are very playful. The speaker is talking of specific dogs,

21
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:18,160
the ones at the doggy park, so the article the is used before the plural noun dogs.

22
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:28,040
Now let's move on to non-count nouns. You may remember from an earlier program that a non-count

23
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:38,800
noun is a noun that we usually do not count, so it does not appear in plural form. Non-count nouns

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:49,240
include materials like gold, substances like water and fire, abstract things like music and justice,

25
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:58,780
and some other things. Generalizations with non-count nouns are not preceded by articles.

26
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:08,460
Let's hear an example. I like listening to music while I exercise. The person is not

27
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,760
speaking of specific music. They are saying they enjoy the general act of listening to music

28
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:26,060
as they exercise. For comparison, here's a specific statement. The music at the show last night was

29
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:34,080
too loud. The person is speaking of specific music, the music at the show last night.

30
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:45,200
So the article the appears before the non-count noun music. The zero article also applies to other

31
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,820
kinds of nouns. For instance, we normally do not put an article in front of a proper noun,

32
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:02,280
a word or group of words that name a specific person, place, or thing. Proper nouns are easy

33
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,320
to identify because they begin with capital letters like the month of August, Seventh Street,

34
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:21,240
Mexico City, Alice, English, and Voice of America. Have a listen. Alice teaches English at Voice of

35
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:29,400
America. Note that none of the proper nouns has an article before it. Articles, however,

36
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,680
must remain in place if they are part of the full name of something, like the newspaper,

37
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:44,040
the New York Times, musical group, A Tribe Called Quest, and country, the Netherlands.

38
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,120
Here's an example. My favorite musical group in high school was A Tribe Called Quest.

39
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:02,220
Now on to transport phrases. No article is used with some phrases that relate to transportation,

40
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:12,900
such as by car, by train, by bus, by air, and on foot. Take this example.

41
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,880
The group traveled from Tangier to Casablanca by train.

42
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:28,160
In addition, we do not use articles with some time words and phrases such as at night,

43
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,480
at midnight, tomorrow, today, and yesterday. Articles also are not used for general time phrases

44
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:51,340
beginning with the word last, such as last night, last week, and last year, as in this example.

45
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:00,440
Last week, I took a painting class for the first time. Next, no article is used

46
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:08,620
for some phrases that relate to well-known institutions or places, such as at home,

47
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:17,980
at work, at school, in class, in college, and in jail. Take this example.

48
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,540
Sorry, I can't talk right now. I'm at work. I'll call you later.

49
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,620
However, in American English, there are a few exceptions, such as at the hospital.

50
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:40,460
And lastly, we do not use articles in relation to the general role of most common places,

51
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:49,440
as with the word class in this sentence. When does class begin in D.C. public schools?

52
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,900
And now back to my cat obsession. I'll tell you later if I decide to get a cat

53
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,620
or just stop liking so many pictures online. I'm Alice Bryant.
