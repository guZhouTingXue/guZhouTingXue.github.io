1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
From VOA Learning English, this is everyday grammar.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,340
What word appears most often in English?

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,740
It's the, also known as the definite article.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,960
Its partner, the indefinite article the,

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,020
is also among the top 10 most frequent words in English.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,980
According to Professor Elka Todeva

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,580
of the SIT Graduate Institute in Brattleboro, Vermont,

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,860
the, and the are also some of the most difficult words

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,800
for learners to figure out how to use without some assistance.

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,380
The, and, and the are called articles.

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,580
Why are these small words so hard to learn?

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,480
More than 200 languages do not have articles.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,380
Other languages have articles,

14
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,460
but use them differently than English does.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,780
As a result, figuring out the logic of English articles

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,960
can be challenging.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,980
Professor Todeva says English article usage

18
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,400
falls into certain patterns.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,100
A basic understanding of common patterns

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,980
can make learning articles easier.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,180
Fairy tales capture one such powerful pattern,

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,340
which Elka Todeva calls the, uh, the switch.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,820
The, uh, the switch occurs between the first and second mention.

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,000
It is a shift from new to already familiar information.

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,860
Listen for the articles as she reads an example.

26
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,100
Pay attention to the way a turns into the

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,420
with the second mention of the old man and the old woman.

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,340
Once upon a time, there was an old man and an old woman

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,520
who lived in a little cottage in a vast open field.

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,420
The old woman and the old man were very hungry,

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,080
so the old woman decided to bake a gingerbread man.

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,580
Before we explore this pattern and fairy tales further,

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,120
let us look at some basic rules for article usage.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,840
A and N are indefinite articles,

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,840
used before nonspecific members of a group or category of nouns.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,980
The article A appears before singular nouns,

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
starting with a consonant sound.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,720
For example, I ate a banana.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,840
The article N comes before singular nouns,

40
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,700
beginning with a vowel sound.

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,560
For example, give me an apple.

42
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,620
The is called a definite article.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,700
The appears before nouns,

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,540
which are specific members of a category.

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,020
As in, I want to see the movie George Clooney just made.

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,980
Also, use the with previously mentioned nouns.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,940
For example, we went to a movie last night.

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,860
The movie was called Spy.

49
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,820
Use the with unique things like the sun, the moon,

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,540
the front door, and the tallest man in the world.

51
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,440
In some situations, there is no article before a noun.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,580
Ramarians call this the zero article.

53
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,600
The zero article appears before proper nouns,

54
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,560
names like Picasso and John Lennon.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,540
It also goes with names of places and institutions,

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,740
which consist of a proper name and another noun,

57
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,680
as in Michigan State University.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,200
There is also no article before the names of days,

59
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,680
months, seasons, and holidays.

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,620
There is no article before geographical names

61
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,540
like Europe, Italy, Tokyo, and Lake Superior.

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,420
The zero article applies to names of languages

63
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,540
and nationalities, as with Chinese or English.

64
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,580
For example, Spanish is spoken in Spain.

65
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,680
But if you are describing the people of that country,

66
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,580
use the definite article.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,220
The Spanish are known for being friendly.

68
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,400
The zero article also goes with names of sports

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,380
and academic subjects.

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,260
Professor Todeva is both a learner and teacher of English.

71
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,140
She says the human brain loves patterns

72
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,240
and finding logic behind things.

73
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,740
She encourages teachers and learners

74
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,680
to explore grammatical patterns in fun, engaging ways.

75
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,840
She calls this grammaring.

76
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,040
Let's look at some common patterns in article usage.

77
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,320
Professor Todeva takes us back to fairy tales

78
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,060
or traditional stories to demonstrate

79
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,520
how the switch from a to the works.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,540
This particular pattern is very beautifully illustrated

81
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,340
in most English fairy tales and in many jokes as well.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Most fairy tales in English start with once upon a time.

83
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,080
There is suspense. There is sweet anticipation.

84
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,760
We are not sure what the story is about yet.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,120
We expect something exciting and something new,

86
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,320
thus the use of the indefinite article

87
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,560
at the beginning of most fairy tales,

88
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,480
as in the following piece from the gingerbread ban.

89
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,200
Once upon a time, there was an old man and an old woman

90
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,500
who lived in a little cottage, first mentioned,

91
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,040
in a vast open field.

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,180
Here, the storyteller uses the indefinite articles

93
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,800
because the characters are new to the listener or reader.

94
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,480
When the information becomes familiar,

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,200
the storyteller uses the definite article, the.

96
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,140
The old woman and the old man were very hungry,

97
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,720
so the old woman decided to bake a gingerbread man.

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,140
You might notice the ah, the switch in most jokes.

99
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Here is an example.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,840
A man walks into a doctor's office.

101
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,600
He has a cucumber up his nose,

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,060
a carrot in his left ear and a banana in his right ear.

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,540
What's wrong with me?

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,160
He asked the doctor because it's already implied,

105
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,000
and the doctor says you're not eating properly.

106
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,540
Notice how the joke sets the stage

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,860
with new information first.

108
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,500
It starts with ah before switching to the.

109
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,480
Another important pattern involves general statements.

110
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,900
General statements refer to all or many members of a group.

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,860
For example, politicians only care about money.

112
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,540
You will often see general statements on bumper stickers

113
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,700
These are small labels on the back of cars

114
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,300
that express the owner's feelings or opinions.

115
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,240
You might see bumper stickers that say

116
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,320
well-behaved women rarely make history

117
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,540
or teachers touch the future.

118
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,540
Notice that general statements use the zero article.

119
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,580
Here's another general statement that you will probably agree with.

120
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,480
Articles are challenging for English learners.

121
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,200
Look for a future everyday grammar

122
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,920
with more tips for using articles.

123
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
Take Professor Tadeva's advice

124
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,220
and let your brain pay attention to some of the patterns

125
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,880
that we just explored.

126
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,460
Happy learning and grammaring with the English language.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,160
